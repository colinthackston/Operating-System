1. What are Orphan and Zombie processes?
   orphan- this process is still executing, but the parent process has died 
   zombie- a zombie process is a process that has completed execution, but is
   still an entry in the process table. The kill command has no effect on these.
   
2. When a child process calls exec, it replaces the current running process with
the newly called process. It actually replaces the current address space with the
new one.
